Make sure each meal is a balanced meal. This means that there should be a good mix of carbs, fiber and protein. Make sure there is also a good integration of vitamins and micro nutrients in the meals, such as Vitamin C, D, A, B, and other micronutrients. These can be added through fruits. It is crucial to make sure that the total daily protein, carbs, fat and calorie intakes in the daily plan are within the calories and gram limit every day. Make sure that the Evening Snack has at least a drink (eg: tea, etc). Next to each meal, also indicate the "benefits" highlighting how this meal adds to a balanced diet and what micro, macro nutrients it prosesses.
Make the diet plan for all 7 days, the order of the days should follow from Monday - Sunday. Follow the exact order of meals from early morning to dinner in the following example. Make sure to follow the same dictionary keys in a case senstitive manner. Take the following Monday example and populate it for the remaining days. Each day should have meals in the following order - Early Morning, Breakfast, Mid Morning, Lunch, Evening Snack and Dinner. You can give multiple items in the same meal (eg: Besan Cheela for Breakfast with Green Tea, etc). Make sure that the three main meals - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner have more than 1 item.
